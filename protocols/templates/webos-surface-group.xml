    <description summary="a way to group multi client surfaces together">
      A surface group is a mechanism to group surfaces together that are
      not part of the same client, hence transiency, nor subsurfaces will
      fit the bill. However the compositor will treat surfaces belonging
      to a group very similarly as to surfaces that are transient.

      The group will be controlled by the process that creates it. The group
      will have a root surface and the grouped surfaces will be added as
      layers on top or below it. The creator of the group will designate a z order
      and a name for each layer. Other processes wanting to add their
      surface into the group need to know the both the name of the group and
      the name of the layer.

      A group can allow anonymous surfaces to be attached to them as well.

      Practical suggestion, the name of the group should match the appId of
      parent surface.
